            <a>My hobbies are to read fanfiction, swim and play video games. </a> 
            <br></br>
            <a> Fanfiction is a way for beginner writers or casual writers to create short stories that due to copyright would never exist otherwise, allowing crossovers between series and writing how they think characters across franchises would interact.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>I like swimming as I like to move fast through the water without having to deal with over-heating or sweat</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>I also play video games like Maplestory, Pokemon and Destiny 2</a>
        </div>
